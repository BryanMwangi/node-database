TOPIC ONE: NUID

I want to start implementing uids for documents as a means of identifying them and
using the nuids to create indices for the documents.

structure of the nuid:
 8 bits        4 bits      4 bits         12 bits
XXXXXXXX    -   XXXX  -   XXXXXXXX  -    XXXXXXXXXXXX
    ^            ^            ^                 ^
    |            |            |                 |
    |            |            |                 |
    |            |            |                 |
   unix       version        pid              rand
 timestamp                                   buffer

So the nuid will contain 4 parts and we will use the timestamp in future for time-based
queries.
unix timestamp: since unix epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00 and will occcupy 8 bits

version:  every version from v1 to vn will occupy 4 bits

pid will contain the pid of the machine executing the nuid generation. This can be used to track
a file in case a db in the cluster pool fails to sync with other db's.


random buffer will act as our
